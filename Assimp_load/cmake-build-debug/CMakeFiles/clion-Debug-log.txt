CMake Deprecation Warning:
  Support for "Extra Generators" like

    CodeBlocks

  is deprecated and will be removed from a future version of CMake.  IDEs may
  use the cmake-file-api(7) to view CMake-generated project build trees.


CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/lib64/cmake/assimp-5.0/assimpTargets.cmake:54 (if):
  if given arguments:

    "ON"

  An argument named "ON" appears in a conditional statement.  Policy CMP0012
  is not set: if() recognizes numbers and boolean constants.  Run "cmake
  --help-policy CMP0012" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.
